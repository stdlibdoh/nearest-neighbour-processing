# Nearest Neighbour Algorithm in Processing
Overview:

Coded for "Foundations of Problem Solving" module, Foundation Year in Computing, Goldsmiths.

Instructions:

Edit the .csv file in /src/data/ to run the algorithm with different values.
Mouse Over triggers the starting node for the route taken.
Colour coded so the route goes from a blue gradient to a red gradient.

Thoughts:

Project will not be updated further. I feel like it has more value in cataloguing my personal progress.
